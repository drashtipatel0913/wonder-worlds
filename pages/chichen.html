            <h1>Chichen Itzá</h1>
            <p>
               Chichén Itzá was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The
               archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichén Itzá was a major
               focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (AD 600 to 900) through the Terminal
               Classic (c. AD 800 to 900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (AD 900 to 1200). The
               site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of
               the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once
               thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most
               contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural
               diffusion.

            <p>
               Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great
               cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse
               population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles
               at the site.

               The ruins of Chichén Itzá are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's
               Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land
               under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of
               Yucatán.

               Chichén Itzá is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in
               2017.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Name and orthography:</div>
            <p>
               The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza." This derives from chi',
               meaning "mouth" or "edge", and chen or cheʼen, meaning "well". Itzá is the name of an ethnic-lineage
               group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation
               for Itza is "enchanter (or enchantment) of the water," from its (itz), "sorcerer", and ha, "water".
               <br><br>
               The name is spelled Chichén Itzá in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages
               to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the
               modern Maya orthography, Chichʼen Itzaʼ (pronounced [tʃitʃʼen itsáʔ]). This form preserves the phonemic
               distinction between chʼ and ch, since the base word chʼeʼen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya)
               begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. Traditional Yucatec Maya spelling in Latin
               letters, used from the 16th through mid 20th century, spelled it as "Chichen Itza" (as accents on the
               last syllable are usual for the language, they are not indicated as they are in Spanish). The word
               "Itzaʼ" has a high tone on the "a" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe).[citation
               needed]
               <br><br>
               Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of
               the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is
               considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define
               because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as Uuc Yabnal
               ("Seven Great House"), Uuc Hab Nal ("Seven Bushy Places"), Uucyabnal ("Seven Great Rulers") or Uc Abnal
               ("Seven Lines of Abnal"). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of
               Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Location</div>
            <img src="assests/Images/ChichenItza3.jpeg" alt="Image 3 of Chichen Itza" class="image-content2">
            <p>
               Chichén Itzá is located in the eastern portion of Yucatán state in Mexico. The northern Yucatán Peninsula
               is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes,
               called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for
               settlement. Of these cenotes, the "Cenote Sagrado" or "Sacred Cenote" (also variously known as the Sacred
               Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous. In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden
               cenote under the Temple of Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archeologists.
               <br><br>
               According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human
               beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged
               the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well
               as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds
               consistent with human sacrifice.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Political organization</div>
            <p>
               Several archeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early
               Classic, Chichén Itzá may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage.
               Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a "multepal" system, which is
               characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages.

               This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the
               "multepal" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya
               scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern
               lowlands in Mexico.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Economy</div>
            <p>
               Chichén Itzá was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee.Participating in
               the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast,
               Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from
               central Mexico and gold from southern Central America.

               Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichen Itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and
               central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">History</div>
            <p>
               The layout of Chichén Itzá site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and
               900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a
               regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending
               down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza
               is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.
            </p>

            <div class="header-text2">Establishment</div>
            <p>
               The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main
               architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the
               basal platform upon which they were built.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text3">Ascendancy</div>
            <p>
               Chichén Itzá rose to regional prominence toward the end of the Early Classic period (roughly 600 AD). It
               was, however, toward the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the
               site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and
               ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the
               decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.
               <br><br>
               As Chichén Itzá rose to prominence, the cities of Yaxuna (to the south) and Coba (to the east) were
               suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some
               point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen
               Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text3">Decline</div>
            <p>
               According to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), Hunac Ceel, ruler
               of Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to
               power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have
               the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no
               survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.
               <br><br>
               While there is some archeological evidence that indicates Chichén Itzá was at one time looted and sacked,
               there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chichén
               Itzá was an active urban center. Archeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a
               regional center by 1100, before the rise of Mayapan. Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help
               resolve this chronological conundrum.
               <br><br>
               After Chichén Itzá elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned. When the Spanish
               arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if these
               Maya were living in Chichen Itza proper, or a nearby settlement. The relatively high population density
               in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there. According to
               post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the Cenote Sagrado remained a place of pilgrimage.

            <img src="assests/Images/ChichenItza5.jpeg" alt="Image 5 of Chichen Itza" class="image-content2">
            <p>
               In 1526, Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions)
               successfully petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucatán. His first campaign in 1527,
               which covered much of the Yucatán Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a
               small fort at Xaman Haʼ, south of what is today Cancún. Montejo returned to Yucatán in 1531 with
               reinforcements and established his main base at Campeche on the west coast. He sent his son, Francisco
               Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula from the north. The
               objective from the beginning was to go to Chichén Itzá and establish a capital.
               <br><br>
               Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichén Itzá, which he renamed Ciudad Real. At first he
               encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his
               soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting
               off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the
               ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all-out
               assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chichén Itzá in
               1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucatán Peninsula.
               <br><br>
               Montejo eventually returned to Yucatán and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large
               Indio-Spanish army and conquered the peninsula. The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included
               Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Modern history</div>
            <p>
               Long abandoned by the Spanish, and then by the newly formed country of Mexico, Chichen Itza became a
               significant architectural site in the mid-1800s. It remains so today.
               <br><br>
               A number of important structures of the original city remain standing, some thanks to restoration efforts
               on the part of the Mexican government. Among them:
               <br><br>
               <strong>El Castillo:</strong> Also known as the Temple of Kukulkan, named for a Mayan deity that appears
               as a feathered serpent. This pyramid-shaped structure stands close to 100 feet high.
               <br><br>
               <strong>The Great Ball Court: </strong>Just to the northwest of El Castillo, this structure was used for
               sport—primarily a team game using a ball.
               <br> <br>
               <strong>The North Temple: </strong>Also called the Temple of the Bearded Man, this small building is
               adjacent to the Great Ball Court and features a carving on its inner walls, with the central figure of a
               man with a carving under his chin that resembles facial hair.
               <br><br>
               <strong>The Steam Bath: </strong>This structure features a water bath and steam chamber operated by using
               heated stones.
               <br><br>
               <strong>Sacbe Number One: </strong>One of the paved streets of the city that extends nearly 900 feet.
               <br><br>
               <strong>Temple of the Warriors: </strong>Another large, stepped pyramid.
               <br><br>
               <strong>Group of a Thousand Columns: </strong>A series of exposed columns that are believed to have
               supported a large roof system.
               <br><br>
               <strong>El Mercado: </strong>A square structure at the southern end of the Temple of the Warriors that
               archeologists believe served as the city’s marketplace.
               <br><br>
               <strong>El Osario: </strong>Another step-pyramid structure with a temple at its peak.
               <br><br>
               Today, some 2 million tourists visit Chichen Itza annually to explore its architectural wonders and gain
               further insight into Mayan history and culture. However, archeologists are still at work on the site.
               <br><br>
               As recently as 2016, scientists discovered a smaller pyramid within El Castillo using modern imaging
               technology. It is believed this smaller structure held religious significance to the Mayans.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Site description</div>
            <p>
               Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered architecture of
               the site core covering an area of at least 5 square kilometers (1.9 sq mi). Smaller scale residential
               architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this. The city was built upon broken terrain, which
               was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort
               being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and
               Main Southwest groups.
               <br><br>
               <img src="assests/Images/ChichenItza3.jpeg" alt="Image 6 of Chichen Itza" class="image-content">
               The site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been
               restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob.
               Archeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions
               from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple
               colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be
               imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like Gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided
               a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.
               <br><br>
               The architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern
               Yucatán Peninsula. The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each
               set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these
               complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of the Temple of Kukulcán (El
               Castillo), Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of
               the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las
               Monjas, and Akab Dzib.
               <br><br>
               South of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chichén Viejo (Old Chichén) and only open to archeologists, are
               several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the
               Old Castle.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Architectural styles</div>
            <p>
               The Puuc-style architecture is concentrated in the Old Chichen area, and also the earlier structures in
               the Nunnery Group (including the Las Monjas, Annex and La Iglesia buildings); it is also represented in
               the Akab Dzib structure. The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper façades
               characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry
               walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper.
               <br><br>
               At least one structure in the Las Monjas Group features an ornate façade and masked doorway that are
               typical examples of Chenes-style architecture, a style centered upon a region in the north of Campeche

                     <h1>1. Chichén Itzá is one of the largest Mayan cities ever built</h1>
                     <p>Chichén Itzá is an ancient Mayan city in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico. The Mayan people built
                        the city in the architectural style of Puuc around 250 AD to 900 AD – this is long before the
                        Aztec period which was 1300 to 1521. It’s one of the largest Mayan cities ever built and
                        occupies an area of 4 square miles (10 square km). At its peak, some 35,000 people would have
                        called it home.</p>

                     <h1>2. Chichén Itzá takes its name from cenotes</h1>
                     <p>Chichén Itzá takes its name from a geological feature of the area and the tribe who settled
                        there. On the site are caves and sinkholes in limestone formations, known as cenotes. These are
                        natural wells that form when limestone surfaces collapse and expose water underneath. Chi means
                        “mouths” and chen means “wells” and Itzá is the name of the Maya tribe that settled there.
                        Chichen Itza means “At the mouth of the well of the Itza.” Chichén Itzá is the Spanish spelling
                        and Chichʼen Itzaʼ is the Mayan spelling.</p>

                     <h1>3. The Maya Peoples built Chichén Itzá</h1>
                     <p>The Maya peoples of the Yucatán Peninsula lived in the region since the Pre-Classic, or
                        Formative, Period (1500 BCE–300 CE). They were the ones who presumably built Chichén Itzá. The
                        earliest structures built include the Akabtzib (“House of the Dark Writing”), the Chichanchob
                        (“Red House”), the Iglesia (“Church”), the Casa de las Monjas (“Nunnery”), and the observatory
                        El Caracol (“The Snail”).</p>

                     <h1>4. Invaders built the Chichén Itzá pyramid</h1>
                     <p>The most famous structure in Chichén Itzá is El Castillo (“The Castle”). In the 10th century,
                        foreigners invaded Chichén and these invaders constructed El Castillo. This is a pyramid that
                        rises 24 metres (79 feet) above the Main Plaza and each of its four sides has 91 stairs that
                        face north, east, south, and west. Including the step on the top platform, there is a total of
                        365 steps. This is the same number of days in the solar year.</p>

                     <p>On top of the Chichén Itzá pyramid is a carving of a feathered serpent. This represents
                        Quetzalcóatl – known to the Maya as Kukulcán. Quetzalcóatl is a combination of the words
                        quetzalli (tail feather of the quetzal bird) and coatl (snake). This plumped serpent is one of
                        the major deities of the ancient Mexican pantheon.</p>

                     <h1>6. The equinox at Chichén Itzá is rather special</h1>
                     <p>During the spring equinox (around March 20th and 21st) and autumn equinox (around September 20th
                        and 21st), something wonderful happens at El Castillo in Chichén Itzá. On these dates, the light
                        of the sun hits the earth directly on the equator. When this happened, the length of the day and
                        night are more or less equal. At this time, the shadows cast by the setting sun give the
                        appearance of Quetzalcóatl/Kukulcán slithering down the steps. Thousands of visitors come every
                        year to watch this phenomenon.</p>
