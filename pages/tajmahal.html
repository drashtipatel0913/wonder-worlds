            <p>Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state,
               northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to
               immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631,
               having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612.India’s most famous
               and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right)
               bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about
               1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.

            <h2>History of Monument</h2>
            <img src="assests/TajMahal/image2.jpg">
            <p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief
               architect was probably
               Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the complex—main
               gateway, garden, mosque,
               jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four
               minarets)—were conceived and
               designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no
               subsequent addition or
               alteration. Building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the
               Ottoman Empire,
               and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by
               1643, and decoration
               work continued until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22
               years.
               A tradition relates that Shah Jahān originally intended to build another mausoleum across the river to
               house his own remains.
               That structure was to have been constructed of black marble, and it was to have been connected by a
               bridge to the Taj Mahal.
               He was deposed in 1658 by his son Aurangzeb, however, and was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra
               Fort.

            <h2>Layout and Architecture</h2>
            <img src="assests/TajMahal/image4.jpeg">
            <div class="content">
               <p>Resting in the middle of a wide plinth 23 feet (7 metres) high, the mausoleum proper is of white
                  marble that reflects
                  hues according to the intensity of sunlight or moonlight. It has four nearly identical facades, each
                  with a wide
                  central arch rising to 108 feet (33 metres) at its apex and chamfered (slanted) corners incorporating
                  smaller arches.
                  The majestic central dome, which reaches a height of 240 feet (73 metres) at the tip of its finial, is
                  surrounded by
                  four lesser domes. The acoustics inside the main dome cause the single note of a flute to reverberate
                  five times. The
                  interior of the mausoleum is organized around an octagonal marble chamber ornamented with low-relief
                  carvings and
                  semiprecious stones (pietra dura). Therein are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahān. Those
                  false tombs are
                  enclosed by a finely wrought filigree marble screen. Beneath the tombs, at garden level, lie the true
                  sarcophagi.
                  Standing gracefully apart from the central building, at each of the four corners of the square plinth,
                  are elegant
                  minarets.
