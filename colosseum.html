            <p>Great Roman amphitheatres were also built at Verona and at ancient Capua (modern Santa Maria Capua
                Vetere), where the amphitheatre, built in the 1st century, is second in size to the Colosseum, with an
                area of 560 by 460 feet (170 by 140 metres) and a height of 95 feet (30 metres). Outside Italy, Roman
                amphitheatres were built at Nîmes and Arles in France, Pula in Istria (Croatia), and Thysdrus (El Jem)
                in Africa (Tunisia). The arenas were about 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 metres) long and about 115 to 200
                feet (35 to 60 metres) wide. Fragmentary remains of more than 75 Roman amphitheatres have been found in
                widely scattered areas throughout the provinces of the Roman Empire. The best preserved in Britain is
                the Roman amphitheatre at Caerleon in the county borough of Newport.Located just east of the Roman
                Forum, the massive stone amphitheater known as the Colosseum was commissioned around A.D. 70-72 by
                Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty as a gift to the Roman people. In A.D. 80, Vespasian’s son
                Titus opened the Colosseum—officially known as the Flavian Amphitheater—with 100 days of games,
                including gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights. After four centuries of active use, the
                magnificent arena fell into neglect, and up until the 18th century it was used as a source of building
                materials. Though two-thirds of the original Colosseum has been destroyed over time, the amphitheater
                remains a popular tourist destination, as well as an iconic symbol of Rome and its long, tumultuous
                history.The Colosseum saw some four centuries of active use, until the struggles of the Western Roman
                Empire and the gradual change in public tastes put an end to gladiatorial combats and other large public
                entertainments by the 6th century A.D. Even by that time, the arena had suffered damaged due to natural
                phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes.

                In the centuries to come, the Colosseum was abandoned completely, and used as a quarry for numerous
                building projects, including the cathedrals of St. Peter and St. John Lateran, the Palazzo Venezia and
                defense fortifications along the Tiber River. Beginning in the 18th century, however, various popes
                sought to conserve the arena as a sacred Christian site, though it is in fact uncertain whether early
                Christian martyrs met their fate in the Colosseum, as has been speculated.

                By the 20th century, a combination of weather, natural disasters, neglect and vandalism had destroyed
                nearly two-thirds of the original Colosseum, including all of the arena’s marble seats and its
                decorative elements. Restoration efforts began in the 1990s, and have proceeded over the years, as the
                Colosseum continues to be a leading attraction for tourists from all over the world.</p>

                <h1>Roman Colosseum, Rome, Italy</h1>
                <p>Colosseum, also called Flavian Amphitheatre, giant amphitheatre built in Rome under the Flavian
                    emperors.
                    Construction of the Colosseum was begun sometime between 70 and 72 CE during the reign of Vespasian.
                    It
                    is located just east of the Palatine Hill, on the grounds of what was Nero’s Golden House. The
                    artificial lake that was the centrepiece of that palace complex was drained, and the Colosseum was
                    sited
                    there, a decision that was as much symbolic as it was practical. Vespasian, whose path to the throne
                    had
                    relatively humble beginnings, chose to replace the tyrannical emperor’s private lake with a public
                    amphitheatre that could host tens of thousands of Romans.The structure was officially dedicated in
                    80 CE
                    by Titus in a ceremony that included 100 days of games. Later, in 82 CE, Domitian completed the work
                    by
                    adding the uppermost story. Unlike earlier amphitheatres, which were nearly all dug into convenient
                    hillsides for extra support, the Colosseum is a freestanding structure of stone and concrete, using
                    a
                    complex system of barrel vaults and groin vaults and measuring 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 metres)
                    overall. Three of the arena’s stories are encircled by arcades framed on the exterior by engaged
                    columns
                    in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders; the structure’s rising arrangement of columns became the
                    basis of the Renaissance codification known as the assemblage of orders. The main structural
                    framework
                    and facade are travertine, the secondary walls are volcanic tufa, and the inner bowl and the arcade
                    vaults are concrete.</p>
