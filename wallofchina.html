            <h1>The great wall of china</h1>
            <p>
               The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
               northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
               nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
               century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220 to 206 BC), the first
               emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and
               maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by
               the Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644).

               The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
               northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various

            </p>
            <p>
               Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the
               imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of
               trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics
               of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison
               stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path
               of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
            </p>
            <p>
               The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they
               stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino Russian
               border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the
               edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. Today, the
               defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive
               architectural feats in history.

               The Great Wall of the Qin stretches from Lintao to Liaodong.
               The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring
               and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC.During this time and the subsequent
               Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and Zhongshan all constructed
               extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small
               arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and
               gravel between board frames.
               <br>
               King Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of
               the Qin dynasty ("Qin Shi Huang") in 221 BC. Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent
               the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that
               divided his empire among the former states. To position the empire against the Xiongnu people
               from the north, however, he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining
               fortifications along the empire's northern frontier. "Build and move on" was a central guiding
               principle in constructing the wall, implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently
               fixed border.

            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Design of the fortifications</div>
            <p>The Great Wall had three major components: passes, signal towers (beacons), and walls.</p>
            <div class="header-text3">Passes</div>
            <p>
               Passes were major strongholds along the wall, usually located at such key positions as intersections with
               trade routes. The ramparts of many passes were faced with huge bricks and stones, with dirt and crushed
               stones as filler. The bastions measured some 30 feet (10 metres) high and 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 metres)
               wide at the top. Within each pass were access ramps for horses and ladders for soldiers. The outside
               parapet was crenellated, and the inside parapet, or yuqiang (nüqiang), was a low wall about 3 feet (1
               metre) high that prevented people and horses from falling off the top. In addition to serving as an
               access point for merchants and other civilians, the gate within the pass was used as an exit for the
               garrison to counterattack raiders or to send out patrols. Under the gate arch there was typically a huge
               double door of wood. Bolts and locker rings were set in the inner panel of each door. On top of each gate
               was a gate tower that served as a watchtower and command post. Usually it stood one to three stories
               (levels) high and was constructed either of wood or of bricks and wood. Built outside the gate, where an
               enemy was most likely to attack, was a wengcheng, a semicircular or polygonal parapet that shielded the
               gate from direct assault. Extending beyond the most strategic wengchengs was an additional line of
               protection, the luocheng, which was often topped by a tower used to watch those beyond the wall and to
               direct troop movements in battles waged there. Around the gate entrance there was often a moat that was
               formed in the process of digging earth to build the fortifications.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text3">Signal Towers</div>
            <p>
               Signal towers were also called beacons, beacon terraces, smoke mounds, mounds, or kiosks. They were used
               to send military communications: beacon (fires or lanterns) during the night or smoke signals in the
               daytime; other methods such as raising banners, beating clappers, or firing guns were also used. Signal
               towers, often built on hilltops for maximum visibility, were self-contained high platforms or towers. The
               lower levels contained rooms for soldiers, as well as stables, sheepfolds, and storage areas.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text3">Walls</div>
            <p>
               The wall itself was the key part of the defensive system. It usually stood 21.3 feet (6.5 metres) wide at
               the base and 19 feet (5.8 metres) at the top, with an average height of 23 to 26 feet (7 to 8 metres), or
               a bit lower on steep hills. The structure of the wall varied from place to place, depending on the
               availability of building materials. Walls were made of tamped earth sandwiched between wooden boards,
               adobe bricks, a brick and stone mixture, rocks, or pilings and planks. Some sections made use of existing
               river dikes; others used rugged mountain terrain such as cliffs and gorges to take the place of man-made
               structures.
               <br><br>

                  class="image-content">

               In the western deserts the walls were often simple structures of rammed earth and adobe; many eastern
               ramparts, such as those near Badaling, were faced with stone and included a number of secondary
               structures and devices. On the inner side of such walls, placed at small intervals, were arched doors
               called juan, which were made of bricks or stones. Inside each juan were stone or brick steps leading to
               the top of the battlement. On the top, on the side facing outward, stood 7-foot- (2-metre-) high crenels
               called duokou. On the upper part of the duokou were large openings used to watch and shoot at attackers,
               and on the lower part were small openings, or loopholes, through which defenders could also shoot. At
               intervals of about 650 to 1,000 feet (200 to 300 metres) there was a crenellated platform rising slightly
               above the top of the wall and protruding from the side that faced attackers. During battle the platform
               provided a commanding view and made it possible to shoot attackers from the side as they attempted to
               scale the wall with ladders. On several platforms were simply structured huts called pufang, which
               provided shelter for the guards during storms. Some platforms, as with signal towers, had two or three
               stories and could be used to store weapons and ammunition. Those at Badaling commonly had two stories,
               with accommodations for more than 10 soldiers on the lower level. There were also drainage ditches on the
               walls to shield them from damage by excessive rainwater.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Military Administration</div>
            <p>
               Each major stronghold along the wall was hierarchically linked to a network of military and
               administrative commands. During the rule of Shihuangdi, 12 prefectures were established along the wall,
               and in the Ming period the whole fortification was divided into 9 defense areas, or zones. A post chief
               (zongbingguan) was assigned to each zone. Together they were known as the Nine Border Garrisons.
            </p>
            <div class="header-text2">Tradition and conservation</div>
            <p>
               The Great Wall has long been incorporated into Chinese mythology and popular symbolism, and in the 20th
               century it came to be regarded as a national symbol. Above the East Gate (Dongmen) at Shanhai Pass is an
               inscription attributed to the medieval historian Xiao Xian, which is translated as “First Pass Under
               Heaven,” referring to the traditional division between Chinese civilization and the barbarian lands to
               the north.
               <br><br>
               Despite the wall's cultural significance, roadways have been cut through it at several points, and vast
               sections have suffered centuries of neglect. In the 1970s a segment near Simatai (68 miles [110 km]
               northeast of Beijing) was dismantled for building materials, but it was subsequently rebuilt. Other areas
               have also been restored, including just northwest of Jiayu Pass at the western limit of the wall; at
               Huangya Pass, some 105 miles (170 km) north of Tianjin; and at Mutianyu, about 55 miles (90 km) northeast
               of Beijing. The best-known section, at Badaling (43 miles [70 km] northwest of Beijing), was rebuilt in
               the late 1950s; it now attracts thousands of national and foreign tourists every day. Portions of the
               wall around Shanhai Pass and at Mount Hu, the eastern terminus, also had been rebuilt by 2000.

                     <p>The great wall of China isn't actually a single wall; it is a network of
                        fortifications. Most of them were built along what was then China's northern borders
                        in order to protect ancient Chinese states from various nomadic groups that lived on
                        the steppes. Parts of the Great Wall extend into present-day North Korea,
                        Mongolia, and even southern Russia.</p>

                     <h1>How wide is the great wall of china?</h1>
                     <p>The Great Wall of China is generally wider at the base than at the top to increase
                        its stability. The base of the Wall has an average width of 21 feet (6.5 meters).
                        The top of the wall has an average width of 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters), which can
                        accommodate a roadway wide enough to let four horsemen ride abreast. The width
                        allowed soldiers to transport weapons and other supplies. The walls on either side
                        of the roadway are typically 1.3 to 1.6 feet (0.4 to 0.5 meters) thick.</p>

                     <h1>What Did the Chinese Call the Great Wall?</h1>
                     <p>The Chinese have had different names
                        for the Great Wall during its long history. The historian Sima Qian (c. 145-86 BC),
                        for example, called it the “Long Rampart(s)” in his work “Records of the Grand
                        Historian.” Back then, the name referred to the walls erected during the Warring
                        States period and those constructed during the reign of the First Emperor, Qin Shi
                        Huang (259 - 210 BC), who unified China and established the Qin Dynasty.</p>

                     <h1>The Book of Song</h1>
                     <p>Another history text, “The Book of Song,” which was published in 493 AD, described
                        the Great Wall as the “long wall of 10,000 miles.” As the First Emperor had a
                        reputation for cruelty, later dynasties avoided calling their additions to the Great
                        Wall the “Long Rampart.” They used such terms as “barrier,” “outer fortress,” and
                        “border wall.” More poetic names for the Great Wall included “the Earth Dragon” and
                        “the Purple Frontier.” During the Qing dynasty (1636 - 1911), which was China's last
                        imperial dynasty, people simply called the Great Wall the “Long Wall.” Many Chinese
                        now call the Great Wall the “Long Wall of 10,000 Li.”</p>

                        walls millennia ago. The oldest known such wall is the Chu Great Wall, which is also
                        called Fancheng. It was erected during the 7th century BC in the Spring and Autumn
                        Period, which makes it roughly 2700 years old. The Chu Great Wall is 310 miles (500
