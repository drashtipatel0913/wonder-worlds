                  <h1>The fascinating origin behind Rio's most famous landmark</h1>
                  <p>The idea of designing a massive statue of Jesus Christ in Rio first came about way back in the
                     1850s, when a local priest came up with the idea of placing a Christian monument on top of Mount
                     Corcovado. Apparently he had requested Princess Isabel (the daughter of Emperor Pedro II and
                     Princess Regent of Brazil at the time), to fund the project, but the idea was scrapped after a
                     Declaration of the Republic was declared in Brazil in 1889 - pinnacle move as it separated the
                     church from the state in the country.

                     It wasn't until after World War I when the Roman Catholic archdiocese in Rio and a group of
                     locals
                     started becoming concerned about the “lack of religious faith” in the Brazilian community, and
                     it
                     was hoped that by placing a massive statue of Jesus on top of a mountain in Rio, it would rebel
                     against what they saw as an “increasing godlessness” in the country. It was requested that the
                     statue be placed on the summit of Mount Corcovado so it would be visible from anywhere and
                     everywhere in Rio, and thus represent a way of “reclaiming Rio” (which was Brazil's capital city
                     at
                     that time) to Christianity.

                  <h1>So… how did the statue get up there?</h1>
                  <p>One of the many things that baffles anyone who feasts their eyes on the statue for the first
                     time is, how the heck did the statue get up there in the first place?

                     Because of the statue's massive size, the statue was actually put together on top of Mount
                     Corcovado, and all the necessary materials (as well as the workers) were transported up the
                     mountain on a small cog-wheel train; (which at the time was mainly used to take tourists to the
                     top of the mountain to see the vistas).

                     Workers used long wooden poles to act as scaffolding during the construction phase, and they
                     actually had to scale them in order to put all the materials in the right place - a task that
                     must have been truly daunting in every sense of the word, yet symbolized the locals' intense
                     religious faith, above all else.

                  <h1>The Story of Rio's famous Statue</h1>
                  <p>Towering 2,310 feet above the city of Rio, the Christ the Redeemer statue has fascinated experts
                     and historians for nearly a hundred years.

                     It's the fourth largest statue of Jesus Christ in the world, the largest Art Deco-style
                     sculpture
                     on the planet, and to top it all off, in 2007 the statue was deemed as one of the New Seven
                     Wonders
                     of the World along with Machu Picchu, the Great Wall of China and the Roman Colosseum.

                     Perched on the summit of Mount Corcovado in Rio, the statue stands at a whopping 98 feet (or 30
                     metres) tall (making it two-thirds the height of New York's Statue of Liberty), and its
                     outstretched arms reach to 92 feet horizontally.

                     Not only is the statue the most recognizable landmark of Rio, it's become a cultural icon of
                     Brazil
                     as well. But most importantly, however, the statue has become a global symbol of Christianity
                     that
                     attracts millions of believers and non-believers to the top of Mount Corcovado every year.
